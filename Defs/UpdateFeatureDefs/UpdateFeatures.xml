		<content>Giddy-up Battle Mounts has been updated with the following changes: 
- Enemy pawns now also use mounts during raids and ambushes!
- The chance that a given enemy pawn spawns with a mount is 40% for tribals and 20% for non-tribals. These chances can be configured in the mod options. 
- Enemy pawns can only mount animals allowed in the mod options. The mounts they use will depend on the environment in which they attack. 
- Fixed issue that sometimes causes mounts to teleport when mounting is interrupted.
